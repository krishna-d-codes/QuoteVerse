## 🧠 How QuoteVerse Works
QuoteVerse uses a predefined collection of curated inspirational quotes. Users can filter by category, generate random quotes, save favorites, customize the interface, and track their progress — all stored locally using `localStorage` to keep the experience personal and persistent.

## 💡 Project Inspiration
The idea for QuoteVerse came from the desire to create a **daily motivation companion** — something simple, elegant, and uplifting. I wanted a tool that not only displays quotes but lets users personalize their experience with themes, favorites, and smooth interactions.  
QuoteVerse was built to be a **calm, inspiring digital space** where users can find motivation, track progress, and brighten their day with a single click.
